Welcome to the README file for the Work Day Scheduler!

## Description
The Work Day Scheduler is a web-based application that allows users to manage their daily schedule from 9am to 5pm. Users can input and save their tasks for each hour of the day, and the application will color-code the tasks based on whether they are in the past, present, or future.

- Removing tasks: To remove a task, just delete the text from the hour's text area and click the "Save" button to save the empty text area.
